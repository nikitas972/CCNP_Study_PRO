### -- STP Topology Changes --

In a stable Layer 2 topology, configuration BPDUs always flow from the root bridge toward the edge switches.
However, changes in the topology (e.g., switch failure, link failure, or links becoming active) impact all the switches in the Layer 2 topology.

###1. **Detection of Topology Change**:
   - The switch that detects a link status change sends a Topology Change Notification (TCN) BPDU toward the root bridge, out its Root Port (RP).
   
###2. **Acknowledgment of TCN**:
   - If an upstream switch receives the TCN, it sends an acknowledgment (ACK) and forwards the TCN out its RP to the root bridge.
   
###3. **Root Bridge Response**:
   - Upon receiving the TCN, the root bridge creates a new configuration BPDU with the topology change flag set, which is then flooded to all switches.
   
###4. **MAC Address Timer Update**:
   - When a switch receives a configuration BPDU with the topology change flag set, all switches change their MAC address timer to the forwarding delay timer (default: 15 seconds).
   - This flushes out MAC addresses for devices that have not communicated within the 15-second window but retains the MAC addresses of actively communicating devices.
   
###5. **Flushing the MAC Address Table**:
   - Flushing the MAC address table prevents a switch from sending traffic to a host that is no longer reachable via that port.
   - A side effect of this is temporarily increased unknown unicast flooding while the table is rebuilt.
   
###6. **Reset of MAC Address Timer**:
   - After receiving the configuration BPDU, the MAC address timer is reset to normal (default: 300 seconds).

### Important Notes:

- TCNs are generated on a per-VLAN basis, so the impact of TCNs correlates with the number of hosts in a VLAN.
- As the number of hosts increases, the likelihood of TCN generation increases, and more hosts are impacted by broadcasts.
- Topology changes should be checked as part of the troubleshooting process. Mechanisms such as PortFast (discussed in Chapter 3) can modify this behavior and reduce TCN generation.

### Troubleshooting:

- Topology changes can be monitored with the command: `show spanning-tree vlan [id] detail` on a switch.
- This command shows the topology change count and the time since the last change occurred.
- A sudden or continuous increase in TCNs indicates a potential problem and should be investigated further for flapping ports or events on a connected switch.
