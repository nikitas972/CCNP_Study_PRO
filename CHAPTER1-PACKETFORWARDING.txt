CCNP  KEY TOPICS   - Chapter 1 - Switching, Packet Forwarding

VLANS
-Provide logical segmentation by creating multiple broadcast domains on the same network switch.
~Vlans provide higher utilization of switch ports because a port can be associated to the necessary broadcast domain, and multiple broadcast domains can reside on the  same switch.
~Network devices in one VLAN cannot communicate with devices ina  different VLAN without a router to itnerconnect VLAN segments.

VLANS = 802.1Q standard ( encapsulation dot1Q),which states that 32 bits are added to the packet header in the following fields : 
-------------------------------------------------------
1)Tag Protocol Identifier (TPID): This 16 bit field is set to 0x8100 to identify the packet as a 802.1Q packet.
2)Priority Code Point (PCP): This 3-bit field indicates a class of Service(CoS) as part of layer 2 quality of service(QoS) between switches.
3)Drop eligible indicator (DEI): This 1 bit field indicates where the packet can be dropped when there is bandwidth contention. 
4)VLAN Identifier (VLAN ID):This 12-bit field specifies teh VLAN associated with a network packet. 

VLAN Packet Structure  : [Dest.MAC|Source.MAC|TPID|PCP|DEI|VLAN.ID|Source.IP|Dest.IP|Payload] 
.........................................[..................................... |16b...|3b...|1b..|12b.......|...........................................]
----------------------------------[--------------------------------[802.1Q Fields    ]---------------------------------------------]

The Vlan identifier has only 12 bits, which  provide 4094 unique VLANS.
Catalyst Swithces use the following logic for VLANS.

																		---VLAN_NUMBERS---
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*VLAN 0 is reserved for 802.1p Traffic and cannot be modified or deleted *																				 -
-*VLAN 1 is the Default VLAN and cannot be modified or deleted*-																							 -
--*VLANS 2 to 1001 are in the normal VLAN range and can be added deleted, or modified as necessary*--							 -
---*VLANS 1002 to 1005 are reserved and cannot be deleted*---																								 -
----*Vlans 1006 to 4094 are in the extended VLAN range and can be added,deleted or modified as necessary*----					 -

Trunk ports can carry multiple VLANS
Trunk ports are typicaly when multiple vlans need connectivity between a switch and another switch, router, or firewall, and only use one port
Upon receipt of the packet on the remote trunk link, the headers are examinedd, traffic is associated to the proper VLAN, then the 802.1Q headers are removed, and traffic is forwarded tot he next port,based on the MAC address for that VLAN.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To statically configure a Trunkport, you just need to type : 
Sw1(config)# Interface [chosen interface]
Sw1(config-if)# switchport mode trunk
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To see which trunk ports you have successfully configured , you can do : 
Show interfaces trunk", or "sh int trunk" as it's faster

The output shoes results in three sections. 

The first section lists interfaces that are trunk ports, the status, and which vlan is the Native for that trunk port. 

The second shows the list of VLANS that are allowed on the trunk port. 
Traffic can be minimized on trunk ports by not allowing specific vlans to specific switches, thereby restricting broadcast traffic too. 

The third section shows vlans that are in the forwarding state . (note : blocked VLANS are not listed in this section )

MAC addressing. 
Mac addressing should be self-explanatory since it's something we've worked on in CCNA1-2-3 but, Every hardware running software has a mac address attached to it which is an identifier, such as 2D-A0-1C-DD-9A-F2
												
														---MAC_TABLES---
***************************************************************************************************************************************************
The MAC address table reside in Content Addressable Memory(CAM)
The CAM uses high-speed memory that is faster than typical computer RAM, due to its search Techniques. The CAM table provides a binary result for any query of 0 for true or 1 for false.
The CAM tables is used with other functions to analyze and forward packets very quickly.
Switches are built with a  large CAM table to accomodate all the layer 2 hosts for which they mantain forwarding tables.

																													Interface status.
A useful command for troubleshooting switch connectivity.
The output is as follows :
 Port  : displays the interface ID or port channel
 Name : displays the configured interface description
 Status: Displays connected if there is a connection. Alternatively displays NOTCONNECT if a connection is not made or on the Disabled-ERR status
 VLAN : Displays vlan number associated with Access Switchport to that port .
 Speed : Displays the speed, if the port speed was auto configured, it displays auto else a-1000

																								-- PROCESS SWITCHING --
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Process switching, also referred to as software switching or slow path, is a switching mechanism in which the general purpose CPU on a  router is in charge of packet switching.
Process switching is the fallback for CEF because it is dedicating to processing punted IP packets when they cannot be switched by the CEF

The types of packets that generally require software handling include the following:
- packets sourced or destined to the router (using control traffic or routing protocols) -
-- packets that are too complex for the hardware to handle (that is, IP packets with  IP options) --
--- packets that require extra information that is not currently known, for example :Unresolved ARP entries ----

																								 -- CEF(Cisco Express Forwarding) -- 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CEF is a cisco switching mechanism developed to keep up with the demands of faster and evolving network infrastructures.
It has been the default switching mechanism on most cisco platforms that do all their switching using the CPU ( software based routers) since the 1990s,
and the default switching mechanism that is used by all cisco platforms that use specialized application circuits, and network processing units.											 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


																								-- TCAM (ternary content addressable memory) --
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A switch's ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) allows for the matching and evaluation of a packet on more than one field.
TCAM is an exctension of CAM but enhanced, to alow for upper-layer processing such as identifying the layer2/3 source destination addresses,protocol,QoS Markings, and so on 
TCAM provides morde flexibility in searching than CAM, which is binary. A TCAM search provides three results: 0 for true, 1 false and X for do not care, which is a ternary combination. 
The TCAM entries are stored in Value,Mask,and REsult(VMR) format. The value indicates that fielss that should be searched, such as the IP address and protocol fields.
The mask indicates the field that is of interest and that should be queried. 
The result indicated that action that should be taken with a match on the value and mask. 
Multiple actions can be selected, besides allowing or dropping traffic, but tats like redirecting a flow to a QoS policer or speciying a pointer to a different entry in the forwarding list table are possible.

																										-- Software CEF --
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Software CEF is known as the FIB (  Forwarding Information base ) consists of the following components.

~ Forwarding Information Base: The FIB is built directly from the routing table and contains the next-hop IP address for each destination in the network. It keeps a mirror image of the forwaring information contained in the   IP routing table. Whena  routing or topology change occurs in the network, the IP routing table is update, and these changes are also reflected in the FIB. CEF uses the FIB to make IP destination prefix-based switching Decisions~
~~Adjacency table : The AIB (adjacency information base) contains the directly connected next-hop IP addresses and their corresponding next-hop MAC addresses, as well as the egress interface's MAC address.
	The AIB is populated with data from the ARP table or other layer 2 protocol tables.
