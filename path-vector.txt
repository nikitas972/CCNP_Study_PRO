###Path Vector Algorithm
The Path Vector Protocol, exemplified by BGP (Border Gateway Protocol), is a type of routing protocol that combines features of both distance vector and link-state protocols. Instead of simply considering the distance to determine the best path, it evaluates various path attributes associated with each route.

###Key Characteristics:
Path Attributes: BGP uses a variety of attributes to assess the quality and preference of routes. Some of the most important path attributes include:
Autonomous System Path (AS_Path): A list of ASes that a route has traversed. This helps in preventing loops.

###Multi-Exit Discriminator (MED): 
A hint to external neighbors about the preferred path into an AS.

###Origin: 
Indicates the origin of the route information.

###Next Hop: 
The next IP address to which packets should be forwarded.


###Local Preference: 
Used within an AS to prefer certain routes over others.



###Atomic Aggregate: 
Indicates that the path has been aggregated.


###Aggregator: 
Information about the AS that performed the aggregation.


Loop Prevention:
To ensure loop-free paths, the path vector protocol maintains a record of each autonomous system (AS) that a routing advertisement traverses. Here's how it works:

When a router receives an advertisement, it checks the AS_Path attribute.
If the router finds its own AS listed in the AS_Path, it rejects the advertisement.
This mechanism prevents routing loops by ensuring that routes do not traverse back through an AS that has already processed them.
