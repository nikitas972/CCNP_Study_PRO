### CCNP KEY TOPICS 
#### Chapter 1 - Switching, Packet Forwarding

---

#### VLANS

- Provide logical segmentation by creating multiple broadcast domains on the same network switch.
    - VLANs provide higher utilization of switch ports because a port can be associated to the necessary broadcast domain, and multiple broadcast domains can reside on the same switch.
    - Network devices in one VLAN cannot communicate with devices in a different VLAN without a router to interconnect VLAN segments.

### VLANs = 802.1Q Standard

- (Encapsulation dot1Q), which states that 32 bits are added to the packet header in the following fields:

---

#### VLAN Packet Structure:

[Dest.MAC | Source.MAC | TPID | PCP | DEI | VLAN.ID | Source.IP | Dest.IP | Payload]

- **Tag Protocol Identifier (TPID)**: 
    - This 16-bit field is set to 0x8100 to identify the packet as an 802.1Q packet.
    
- **Priority Code Point (PCP)**: 
    - This 3-bit field indicates a Class of Service (CoS) as part of Layer 2 Quality of Service (QoS) between switches.
    
- **Drop Eligible Indicator (DEI)**: 
    - This 1-bit field indicates where the packet can be dropped when there is bandwidth contention.
    
- **VLAN Identifier (VLAN ID)**: 
    - This 12-bit field specifies the VLAN associated with a network packet.

---

The VLAN identifier has only 12 bits, which provides 4094 unique VLANs.

### Catalyst Switches Use the Following Logic for VLANs:

---

**---VLAN_NUMBERS---**

- VLAN 0 is reserved for 802.1p Traffic and cannot be modified or deleted.
  
- VLAN 1 is the Default VLAN and cannot be modified or deleted.
  
- VLANs 2 to 1001 are in the normal VLAN range and can be added, deleted, or modified as necessary.
  
- VLANs 1002 to 1005 are reserved and cannot be deleted.
  
- VLANs 1006 to 4094 are in the extended VLAN range and can be added, deleted, or modified as necessary.

### Creating a VLAN

s1# Configure Terminal
s1(config)# vlan 10
s1(config)# name Tenth
s1(config)# exit
