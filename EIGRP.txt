### Enhanced Distance Vector Algorithms

The **Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL)** is an enhanced distance vector algorithm that EIGRP uses to calculate the shortest path to a destination within a network. EIGRP advertises network information to its neighbors as other distance vector protocols do, but it has some enhancements, as its name suggests. 

The following are some of the enhancements introduced into this algorithm compared to other distance vector algorithms:
- It offers rapid convergence time for changes in the network topology.
- It sends updates only when there is a change in the network. It does not send full routing table updates in a periodic fashion, as distance vector protocols do.
- It uses hellos and forms neighbor relationships just as link-state protocols do.
- It uses bandwidth, delay, reliability, load, and maximum transmission unit (MTU) size instead of hop count for path calculations.
- It has the option to load balance traffic across equal- or unequal-cost paths.

EIGRP is sometimes referred to as a hybrid routing protocol because it has characteristics of both distance vector and link-state protocols, as shown in the preceding list. EIGRP relies on more advanced metrics other than hop count (for example, bandwidth) for its best-path calculations. 

By default, EIGRP advertises the total path delay and minimum bandwidth for a route. This information is advertised in every direction, as happens with a distance vector routing protocol; however, each router can calculate the best path based on the information provided by its direct neighbors.



### EIGRP Message Types

**EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)** uses several message types for communication between routers. Each message type serves a specific purpose in the routing process:

1. **Hello**
   - **Purpose**: Used for the discovery of EIGRP neighbors.
   - **Function**: Detects when a neighbor is no longer available.

2. **Request**
   - **Purpose**: Used to request specific information from one or more neighbors.
   - **Function**: Allows routers to obtain details about routes from neighboring routers.

3. **Update**
   - **Purpose**: Used to transmit routing and reachability information to other EIGRP neighbors.
   - **Function**: Updates neighboring routers with changes in routing information.

4. **Query**
   - **Purpose**: Sent out to search for another path during convergence.
   - **Function**: Used when a router needs to find an alternative route to a destination.

5. **Reply**
   - **Purpose**: Sent in response to a query packet.
   - **Function**: Provides information back to the router that issued the query.
