### -- STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) Key Terms --

###- **Root Bridge**:
  The root bridge is the most important switch in the Layer 2 topology.
  - All ports are in the forwarding state.
  - This switch is considered the top of the spanning tree for all path calculations by other switches.
  - All ports on the root bridge are designated ports.

###- **Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU)**:
  A BPDU is a network packet used by switches to identify the hierarchy and notify changes in the topology.
  - BPDUs use the destination MAC address `01:80:c2:00:00:00`.
  - **Types of BPDUs**:
    - **Configuration BPDU**:
      Identifies the root bridge, root ports, designated ports, and blocking ports.
      It consists of the following fields: STP type, root path cost, root bridge identifier, local bridge identifier, max age, hello time, and forward delay.
    - **Topology Change Notification (TCN) BPDU**:
      Communicates changes in the Layer 2 topology to other switches.

###- **Root Path Cost**:
  A 4-bit value that indicates the preference for a switch to become the root bridge. The default value is 32,768.

###- **System ID Extension**:
  A 12-bit value that shows the VLAN the BPDU correlates to. The system priority and system ID extension combine to help identify the root bridge.


###- **Root Bridge Identifier**:
  A combination of the root bridge system's MAC address, system ID extension, and system priority, used to identify the root bridge.


###- **Local Bridge Identifier**:
  Similar to the root bridge identifier but specific to the local bridge, combining the system MAC address, system ID extension, and system priority.


###- **Max Age**:
  The maximum amount of time a bridge port saves its BPDU information.
  - Default value: 20 seconds.
  - This can be changed with the command: `spanning-tree vlan [vlan] max age [int]`.
  - If a switch loses contact with the BPDU source, it assumes the BPDU information is still valid for the duration of the Max Age timer.


###- **Hello Time**:
  The interval at which a BPDU is advertised out of a port.
  - Default value: 2 seconds.
  - Can be configured between 1 to 10 seconds using the command: `spanning-tree vlan [vlan] hello time [time]`.



###- **Forward Delay**:
  The amount of time a port remains in the listening and learning states.
  - Default value: 15 seconds.
  - Can be changed to 15â€“30 seconds using the command: `spanning-tree vlan [vlan] forward time [time]`.
